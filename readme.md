This was part of a hackday project - it's the equivalent of the [Batman equation], but for the Shazam logo symbol. So, it's a (non-parametric) equation which, when its zeros are plotted, gives the Shazam (the music app) logo symbol.

"Shazam" and its logo are trademarks and registered trademarks of Shazam Entertainment Limited.

This was first drafted using the default Grapher app in OSX, and the refined further into a Mathematica notebook.
